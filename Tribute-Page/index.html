        <p>
          "When I first met Dhoni in 2005, I was taken by his strength and the
          fact that he hit balls into parts of the field that others
          couldn't,""Short balls that most pulled through midwicket, MS hit
          straight back past startled bowlers. His back-foot, short-armed
          punches down the ground were also a signature shot but what impressed
          me most of all was his ability to clear boundaries at will."<br/><br/>
